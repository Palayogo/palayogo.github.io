He realized two problems, problem number 1 is that **the source code and the \\"build\\" of xz in these 2 versions was different**, and problem number 2 is that **the \\"build\\" of xz contained a [\\"backdoor\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing))**, **malicious code (\\"malware\\") which gives access to your computer to the creator of the virus**.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nOnly versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of xz contain this malicious code. If your Linux contains an earlier version of xz your computer is not at risk.\\r\\n\\r\\n--------\\r\\n\\r\\nTo find out your version of xz, open your terminal and type this code and do not look at the version of the xz package:\\r\\n\\r\\n```bash\\r\\nxz --version\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n:::caution Attention:\\r\\nThe list of distributions affected or not **dates 03/30/2024**, please check the version of your xz for yourself (**reminder: only versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 are the infected versions**)\\r\\n\\r\\n----------------\\r\\n\\r\\nIf **your Linux distribution is not in these lists**, please check the version of your xz for yourself (**reminder: only versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 are the infected versions**)\\r\\n\\r\\n----------------\\r\\n\\r\\n**The distributions below are mostly \xae\ufe0f or \xa9\ufe0f**.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n# List of affected Linux distributions:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Fedora 40 (xz version: 5.6.0 / 5.6.1)\\r\\n- OpenSuse Tumbleweed rolling release (version xz: 5.6.1)\\r\\n- Debian testing / unstable / experimental (**Update your system to fix NOW**) (version xz: 5.6.0 / 5.6.1)\\r\\n- Kali Linux Latest Version (xz version: 5.6.0 / 5.6.1)\\r\\n- Gentoo testing (version xz: 5.6.0)\\r\\n- Arch Linux Latest Version (xz version: 5.6.0 / 5.6.1)\\r\\n\\r\\n# List of unaffected Linux distributions:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Red Hat enterprise Linux 8, 9 and earlier (derivatives (Almalinux, ...) included) (version xz: 5.2 and earlier)\\r\\n- Fedora 38, 39 and earlier (xz version: 5.4.4, 5.4.1 and earlier)\\r\\n- Suse Linux Enterprise 15 service pack 15 and earlier (version xz: 5.2 and earlier)\\r\\n- OpenSuse Leap 15.5 and earlier (xz version: 5.2 and earlier)\\r\\n- Debian stable (version xz: 5.4.1)\\r\\n- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, earlier and distributions based on it (version xz: 5.4.5 and earlier)\\r\\n- Gentoo (xz version: 5.4.2)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Now how to solve this problem? :\\r\\n\\r\\n### Option 1 : Update your Linux :\\r\\n\\r\\nUbuntu, Debian, ... : \\r\\n\\r\\n```bash\\r\\nsudo apt update\\r\\nsudo apt upgrade\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nFedora, Red Hat, Centos, OpenSuse, ... :\\r\\n\\r\\n```bash\\r\\nsudo dnf update\\r\\nsudo dnf upgrade\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Option 2 : Reinstall the os :\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, if the update don\'t fix the problem, you can reinstall your Linux.\\r\\nDon\'t forget to backup your documents."},{"id":"carpark-ten-k","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/carpark-ten-k","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-27-carpark-ten-K/index.md","title":"Palayogo Carpark have now 10K visits !","description":"For the 10K visits of Palayogo Carpark, a video on the history of Palayogo Carpark should be published on our Youtube in a few months.","date":"2024-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 27, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Palayogo","permalink":"/blog/tags/palayogo"},{"label":"Palayogo Carpark","permalink":"/blog/tags/palayogo-carpark"},{"label":"Roblox","permalink":"/blog/tags/roblox"}],"readingTime":1.05,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Cipriyo","title":"CEO","url":"https://github.com/cipriyo","imageURL":"/img/cipriyo_avatar.jpg","key":"cipriyo"},{"name":"Palayogo","url":"https://github.com/palayogo","imageURL":"/img/palayogo_avatar.png","key":"palayogo"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"carpark-ten-k","title":"Palayogo Carpark have now 10K visits !","authors":["cipriyo","palayogo"],"tags":["Palayogo","Palayogo Carpark","Roblox"],"image":"/img/palayogo_carpark_img.png","hide_table_of_contents":true},"prevItem":{"title":"A backdoor (malware) in your linux (xz) (CVE-2024-3094) ?","permalink":"/blog/linux-xz-backdoor-03-2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to create a bootable USB with Rufus ?","permalink":"/blog/rufus-bootable-usb"}},"content":":::info Video:\\r\\nFor the 10K visits of Palayogo Carpark, a video on the history of Palayogo Carpark should be published on our Youtube in a few months.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\\"/img/palayogo_carpark_img.png\\" alt=\\"Palayogo Carpark Image\\"></img>\\r\\n\\r\\n# This article in summary:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn **Wednesday March 27, 2024** Palayogo Carpark reached 10k visits.
